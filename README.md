# Your Project Title

## Description 
Initially I misunderstood the assesment and thought I had to created the whole webpage from scratch and got halfway through doing so, almost completing the CSS for it as well. However, I was then lucky enough to have a beautiful fellow coder help me out and explain that we only had to add some improvement and fix a bug in one of the links. 

I managed to complete the homework and refactor the code. 
Semantic HTML was added and image links were fixed.
